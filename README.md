## My Favorite Projects

### [FTP Pull](https://github.com/migillett/FTP_Pull)
A script to automatically connect to a FTP server and download all files with specific file extensions. Great for downloading commercials or assets from content providers.

### Automatic Video Editing Script
This is a private repository - as it is built for a specific use-case at my work - but it combines FTP pull with the open-source program [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [MoviePy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/) to download, edit, export, and upload content to digital signage. The program uses FFMPEG's blackdetect function to search through the downloaded media file and find the in and out points of black video. The program then cuts that black portion of the video out, drops in a 3-minute PSA break, exports that file, and uploads the finished file to our digital signage server.

### [Easy SQLite3](https://github.com/migillett/Easy_SQLite3)
This script simplifies a lot of the tedium when using a SQLite3 database in new projects. I've adapted a bunch of scripts into one centralized class that is importable and allows you to call functions really easily including converting to and from dictionaries/sql queries.

### [AJA Kumo Automation](https://github.com/migillett/AJA-Kumo-Automation)
A fork from [szumlins/scripts](https://github.com/szumlins/Scripts), this script allows you to automate the switching of video inputs and outputs on a AJA Kumo 16/16 video router.

### [PDF Web Scraper](https://github.com/migillett/PDF-Downloader)
A web-scraping script to download all PDFs from a given URL.

### [RAW to JPEG](https://github.com/migillett/RAW-to-JPEG)
Converts Canon, Sony, and Nikon RAW images into JPEGs for archiving and space efficiency
