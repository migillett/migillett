## My Favorite Projects

### [FTP Pull](https://github.com/migillett/FTP_Pull)
A script to automatically connect to a FTP server and download all files with specific file extensions. Great for downloading commercials or assets from content providers.

### Automatic Video Editing Script
This is a private repository - as it is built for a specific use-case at my work - but it combines FTP pull with the open-source program [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [MoviePy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/) to download, edit, export, and upload content to digital signage.

### [AJA Kumo Automation](https://github.com/migillett/AJA-Kumo-Automation)
A fork from [szumlins/scripts](https://github.com/szumlins/Scripts), this script allows you to automate the switching of video inputs and outputs on a AJA Kumo 16/16 video router.

### [RAW to JPEG](https://github.com/migillett/RAW-to-JPEG)
Converts Canon, Sony, and Nikon RAW images into JPEGs for archiving and space efficiency
